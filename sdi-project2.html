<p>Day care Theme. This app would enable daycare providers and teachers to easily follow up with with parents regarding payments or even if the child is not supposed to be at school for any particular reason. Often times parents may not realize that they have fees due so my idea is to enable an app to make everyone aware. This is app would be able to be used for payments, alerts, sign ins etc. I chose this particular theme because I have worked in the daycare industry and I understand how frustrating these particular issues can be. I definitely think that it will be extremely useful.

This app can also be useful for signature, For instance, in FL they have a program called ELC that pays for most of the child's tuition and the parents only have to pay a small fee. Well one of the requirements that the daycare provider absolutely must do is have signature that match the person driver license of who ever is picking up the child. With that I would ask the parents whoever is authorized to pick up their child has to sign in to our system and set up a pin of some sort, use their signature and save it. So the next time that person uses their pin it will duplicate the signature</p>
